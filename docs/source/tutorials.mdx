# Overview

Welcome to the 🤗 Simulate tutorials! These beginner-friendly tutorials will guide you through the fundamentals of working with 🤗 Simulate. You'll load and prepare an environment for training with your Deep RL framework of choice. Along the way, you'll learn how to define and load different Assets, Sensors and Actuators, watch an RL Agent interact with and see what's inside your environment and share a dataset to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/Spaces).

## Examples
The examples assume some basic knowledge of Python, Deep Reinforcement Learning and a Deep RL framework like [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
If you're already familiar with these, feel free to check out the [quickstart](./quickstart) to see what you can do with 🤗 Simulate. If you want to learn more about Deep Reinforcement Learning, check of the 🤗 [Deep RL course](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class#the-hugging-face-deep-reinforcement-learning-class-).

<Tip>
The examples only cover the basic skills you need to use 🤗 Simulate. There are many other useful functionalities and applications that aren't discussed here. You can find more here TODO

## Advanced Usage

This section is for users looking to gain speed, run more advanced simulations, or use tools that are recently added.

For example, these include how to achieve high throughput training with Map Pools, the [sample-factory](https://alex-petrenko.github.io/sample-factory/) RL framework and running Simulate on a GCP instance
